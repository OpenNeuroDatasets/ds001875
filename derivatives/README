Preprocessed derivatives are provided along with the raw data. Preprocessed derivatives include skull-stripped T1 images, eddy-corrected DWI images and confound-regressed resting-state fMRI images. All preprocessed derivative images were reoriented to account for data that were acquired in the sphinx position. Eddy-corrected DWI images and corresponding b-files are concatenations of runs 1 and 2 for each subject. Confound-regressed resting-state fMRI are registered to the macaque F99 template while all other derivative images remained in subject space.
