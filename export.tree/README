This dataset contains the raw MRI data used to build and validate the macaque connectome in TheVirtualBrain (thevirtualbrain.org), a software platform for large-scale network modelling. It includes T1, DWI and resting-state fMRI scans from 9 macaques. In addition to the raw data, we also provide preprocessed derivatives.

Other derivatives such as the macaque connectome, associated ROI parcellation and other data useful for large-scale modelling in TheVirtualBrain can be found at Zenodo.org (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1471588).
